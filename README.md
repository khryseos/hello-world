# hello-world
first repository to learn the basics of git

Just trying how this thing works, looks pretty good to me, obviously made by many smart people.
I think I will stick to Git for my future version control.

Many thanks to the one in a million who'll see this first after me for looking up my very first repository!
You will always have a special place in my heart, no who am I kidding no one will see this lol
